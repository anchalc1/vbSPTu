% relpath=SM_relative_path(path1,path2)
%
% Compute out the relative path from path1 to path2, which must be
% (absolute) paths with a common root.
%
% Note that the inputs are treated as paths even if they do not end with a
% filesep character, for example if called by complete paths to file names.
% What is actually done is 
% [pathX,~,~]=fileparts([pathX filesep]); % for X=1,2
%
% The inputs do not need to exist, but they do need to have some common
% root, e.g., /home/restofpath1, /home/restofpath2, or c:\path1, c:\path2)
