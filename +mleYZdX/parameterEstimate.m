function [est,est2]=parameterEstimate(W,varargin)
% [est,est2]=parameterEstimate(W,dt,...)
% Estimate some model properties and parameters.
%
% minimal operation:
%
% W     : converge HMM model struct
%
% est   : parameter struct with fields
%             D: diffusion constant
%        lambda: 2*D*dt
%            p0: initial state probability
%          pOcc: total occupancy (from variational state distribution)
%           pSS: steady state of the transition matrix A
%             A: transition matrix
%    dwellSteps: mean dwell time in units of time step
%     dwellTime: mean dwell times in units of time
% est2  : same as est, but for the 2-state coarse-grained model described
%         below.
%
% optional input: parameterEstimate(W,dt,'2state',Dthr) produces additional
%               parameter estimates est2 for a coarse-grained model with a
%               slow (D<=Dthr) and a fast (D>Dthr) state, by simply adding
%               up the summary statistics into two groups. If either of the
%               two groups are empty, all parameter estimates are NaN.
