to do:
- get rid of VBinitHidden?
- create an abstract superclass to list all common core methods and
  syntax in one place?
- GUI fill out '-' for missing opt struct fields
- unknown prior types to updateGUIoptions: load them and write empty
  GUI text fields?
- make sure to update prior.XXX.type when editing priors in GUI
- add and print license texts
- rename YZShmm.runAnalysis ?
- initial W.P from priors: check P.wB?
- a new class with aggregate diffusion constants and possibly
  forbitten transitions (wBstruct, or interpreting wB=0 as forbidden
  entries?)
- write simple test scripts, that systematically tests and
  demonstrates all functionality of all model classes
- check that N=1 is handle correctly, in terms of priors and KL-terms
- separate state estimates from Siter
- make the data a static part of the model objects, using a handle
  class if nothing lse works...
- change Tmin (used now) two trjLmin (as in vbSPT)?
- consistently use W.P.aggregate-type fields for diffusion constant
  and deatch rates
