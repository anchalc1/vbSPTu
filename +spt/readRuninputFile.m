% opt=spt.readRuninputFile(runinputfile)
%
% convert SMeagol runinput parameters from a runinput file into an options
% structure opt. All variables created by the command eval(runinputfile)
% are stored in the opt structure.
%
% Additionally, the absolute path to the runinput file is stored in
% opt.runinput_root, to make it possible to interpret paths in the runinput
% file relative to the location of that file.
%
% If a struct object is passed, it is simply returned. This is a convenient
% way to make it possible to use opt structures as alternative input in all
% sorts of SM simulation files without having to perform string-tests etc
% each time. However, this does not perform the above path operations.
